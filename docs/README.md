# Documentation Index

This folder is the long-term source of truth for architecture, decisions, changelogs, and learning notes.

## Structure

- `architecture/`:
  - System design, data pipeline, database schema, phase execution runbook
- `decisions/`:
  - Decision log with alternatives, trade-offs, and interview framing
- `learning-notes/`:
  - Topic-wise deep dives for Data Layer, ML Engine, API, Infrastructure, Frontend, MLOps
- `changelogs/`:
  - Session-level execution logs (what changed, why, validation evidence, next backlog)

## How To Use

1. Start with `architecture/` for system-level understanding.
2. Read `decisions/decision-log.md` to understand why each major design choice was made.
3. Use `learning-notes/` for interview prep and future skill-building.
4. Review `changelogs/` to track implementation history and pending follow-ups.

## Recommended Start Order

1. `architecture/phase-execution-runbook.md` for phase-by-phase command flow.
2. `architecture/system-design.md` and `architecture/data-pipeline.md` for system context.
3. `decisions/decision-log.md` for interview framing.
4. `learning-notes/` for concept deep dives and revision.
