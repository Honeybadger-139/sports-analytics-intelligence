# API Layer — Learning Notes

> 📌 **Status**: Placeholder — will be populated during **Phase 4**.

## What Is the API Layer?

The API Layer exposes the platform's capabilities as RESTful endpoints using FastAPI. It's the interface between the ML Engine and the outside world (frontend, mobile apps, third-party integrations).

## Planned Topics

- FastAPI design patterns and dependency injection
- API versioning and backwards compatibility
- Request validation with Pydantic
- Error handling and response schemas
- Authentication and rate limiting
