## Latest Learning Context

Recently completed and documented:

1. Phase 1A: H2H + non-leaky pregame streak reliability.
2. Phase 1B: Advanced metric completeness and targeted backfill strategy.
3. Observability hardening: self-healing `pipeline_audit` bootstrap.
4. Phase 2 backend operations: prediction persistence/performance APIs + bankroll ledger endpoints.
5. Phase 3A frontend integration: operations console modules wired to live APIs.
6. Phase 3C redesign: tab-based UX for home, raw data, quality monitoring, and analysis.
7. Phase 4 foundation: RAG intelligence endpoints + context brief integration.
8. Phase 5 foundation: MLOps monitoring + retrain policy API surfaces.
9. Phase 4B hardening batch: source-quality scoring, feed-health telemetry, and Intelligence tab filters.
10. Phase 5A hardening batch: monitoring snapshot persistence + trend API contract.
11. Phase 5A hardening batch 2: escalation policy + incident workflow mapping.
12. Phase 5B batch 1: retrain queue automation with duplicate guard + audit endpoint.
13. Phase 5B batch 2: retrain worker lifecycle integration (`run-next` endpoint + status transitions).
14. Phase 6A batch 1: GitHub Actions regression gate for ingestion/routes/config contracts.
15. Phase 6B batch 2: DB-backed integration tests for ingestion integrity invariants.
16. Phase 6C batch 3: runtime parity hardening (SSL warning removal + Python 3.11 baseline guidance).

## Suggested Progression

1. Master Data Layer and API Layer first.
2. Deepen ML Engine with experiment discipline.
3. Execute Intelligence Layer topics in Phase 4, then MLOps in Phase 5.
