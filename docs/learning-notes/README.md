## What To Study Next

Use this roadmap for future preparation:

- [Future Learning Roadmap](future-learning-roadmap.md)
- [Phase Execution Runbook](../architecture/phase-execution-runbook.md)

## Latest Learning Context

Recently completed and documented:

1. Phase 1A: H2H + non-leaky pregame streak reliability.
2. Phase 1B: Advanced metric completeness and targeted backfill strategy.
3. Observability hardening: self-healing `pipeline_audit` bootstrap.

## Suggested Progression

1. Master Data Layer and API Layer first.
2. Deepen ML Engine with experiment discipline.
3. Add MLOps and Intelligence Layer topics once Phase 0/1 are stable.
