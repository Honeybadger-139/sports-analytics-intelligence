# Intelligence Layer — Learning Notes

> 📌 **Status**: Placeholder — will be populated during **Phase 3**.

## What Is the Intelligence Layer?

The Intelligence Layer adds **AI reasoning** on top of raw predictions. It combines a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agent with a rule engine to provide context-aware sports intelligence.

## Planned Modules

- **RAG Agent** — News feeds + ChromaDB + Gemini LLM for contextual analysis
- **Rule Engine** — Post-prediction filters (injury reports, rest patterns, travel fatigue)
- **Embeddings** — Vector representations of sports context for semantic search

## Coming Soon

This folder will contain learning notes on:
- RAG architecture and when to use it
- Vector databases (ChromaDB) vs traditional databases
- Embedding models and similarity search
- Prompt engineering for domain-specific LLM applications
