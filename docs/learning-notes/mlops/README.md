## What Is MLOps?

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is the practice of deploying, monitoring, and maintaining ML models in production. It bridges the gap between "model works in a notebook" and "model works reliably at scale, 24/7."

## Planned Topics

- Model versioning and experiment tracking (MLflow)
- Data drift and model performance monitoring
- Automated retraining pipelines
- A/B testing for model deployments
- CI/CD for ML models
